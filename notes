# Quick checklist for deployment on Railway

1. Push repo to GitHub.
2. On Railway, create new project → deploy from GitHub → choose this repo.
3. Railway should detect `package.json`. Configure start command `node server/index.js` if needed.
4. Add Redis plugin (Provisioned Redis) — Railway will provide `REDIS_URL`.
5. Deploy. The app will serve the client build from `client/dist`.

# Final notes / next steps I can help with
- Add GitHub Actions to build/test on push.
- Add optional authentication (e.g., GitHub OAuth) to tie scores to users.
- Polish styling, accessibility, or add more games (2048, Memory, Pong).
- Add unit tests for server endpoints.
